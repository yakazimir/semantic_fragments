This repo contains various code and datasets used for the two probing
studies discussed below. 

Semantic Fragments 
================================

Repository for semantic fragment experiments in the following paper:
**Probing Natural Language Inference Models through Semantic
Fragments**[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07521.pdf]  (*AAAI 2020*)

For reproducing the experiments, please see the README in
`scripts`. More information about the different datasets see `data`
and the README there.

Probing with Expert Knowledge
================================

This repo contains the data and code for the paper **What Does My QA
Model Know: DEvising Controlled Probes using Expert
Knowledge**[https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.13337] (TACL 2020) 

For reproducing the experiments, please see README in `scripts_mcqa`
(with pointers to original experimental data), and the raw datasets in `data_mcqa`.
